# Getting Started with V programming

Languages now are being developed not only to solve problems but to also create fast softwares. V programming is a programming language that is used to create interactive software in the visual programming environment. It has been recognized by many software developers especially backend developers. It has been labeled as Vlang and goes with an abbreviation of V. It is one of the statically typed programming languages which extra features. It has an added advantage of no global state and also a hot reloading feature. Moreover, one of the added feature which most developers have been anticipating finally is here. V has been the only language which is in a position to load even the no dependencies. It is able to load with any libraries attached like other languages do. Despite its simplicity, V gives the developer a lot of power and may be utilized in a wide range of fields. These fields includes systems programming, web development, game development, GUI development, mobile (wip), science, embedded programming, tooling, and many fields.

# Prerequisite
V programming is a language which can be used for all purposes. It is good for large programs which require compilations. It helps to overcome the crunchy library loading memory.Vlang is one of the languages which do utilise memory. This is the major reason to why it is reffered to as a fast compiling language when it comes to speed and efficiency. 
To get started with V programming you can use any editor of your choice but i would prefer using Vscode for this tutorial. Alongside i will install a Vlang extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vlanguage.vscode-vlang).

## V programming data types.

## No null
## No global variables
Languages are always expected to come up with a program which will aid be extended later. 


## No undefined values
## No undefined behavior
## No variable shadowing
## Bounds checking
